    "\"\"\"Q4. What is the relationship between Bayes' theorem and conditional probability?\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: Conditional probability measures the probability of an event A occurring given that event B has \n",
    "occurred and is denoted as P(A|B). It calculates the likelihood of event A happening when we have \n",
    "information about event B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes theorem provides a way to calculate conditional probability by considering both the prior \n",
    "probability of event A occurring (P(A)) and the probability of event B occurring given that event A has\n",
    "occurred (P(B|A)). The theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs or probabilities based on new\n",
    "evidence or information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, Bayes theorem is expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, P(A|B) represents the conditional probability of event A occurring given event B has occurred. \n",
    "P(B|A) is the conditional probability of event B occurring given event A has occurred. P(A) is the \n",
    "prior probability of event A occurring, and P(B) is the prior probability of event B occurring.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, Bayes theorem provides a formula to calculate the conditional probability P(A|B) by incorporating \n",
    "the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B), as well as the probability of the evidence P(B|A). It allows us \n",
    "to update our beliefs or probabilities based on observed evidence, which is a fundamental aspect of \n",
    "conditional probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q5. How do you choose which type of Naive Bayes classifier to use for any given problem?\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: When choosing which type of Naive Bayes classifier to use for a given problem, it is important to \n",
    "consider the specific characteristics of the data and the assumptions made by each variant of the Naive \n",
    "Bayes algorithm. The choice typically depends on the nature of the problem and the underlying data. \n",
    "Here are some factors to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical vs. Continuous Features: The choice of Naive Bayes classifier depends on the type of \n",
    "features in your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "For datasets with categorical features, the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is commonly used. It \n",
    "assumes that features have discrete counts or frequencies.\n",
    "For datasets with continuous features, the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier is often suitable. It \n",
    "assumes that features follow a Gaussian (normal) distribution.\n",
    "Feature Independence Assumption: All Naive Bayes classifiers make the assumption of feature independence,\n",
    "meaning that the features are assumed to be conditionally independent given the class label.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the independence assumption holds reasonably well in your dataset, the Gaussian Naive Bayes \n",
    "classifier can be effective for continuous features.\n",
    "If the features are categorical or binary and the independence assumption is reasonable, the Multinomial\n",
    "Naive Bayes classifier is a good choice.\n",
    "Text Classification: In text classification tasks, the Bernoulli Naive Bayes classifier and the \n",
    "Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier are commonly used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bernoulli Naive Bayes classifier works well when the presence or absence of words (binary features) \n",
    "is considered in text classification.\n",
    "The Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is suitable when the frequency of words or other discrete \n",
    "features is used.\n",
    "Laplace Smoothing: Another consideration is whether or not to apply Laplace smoothing (also known as \n",
    "add-one smoothing or additive smoothing) to handle zero-frequency issues when estimating probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Laplace smoothing can be useful when there is limited data or when there are unseen feature-label \n",
    "combinations in the training set.\n",
    "If you have a substantial amount of training data and all feature-label combinations are observed, you \n",
    "might not need to apply smoothing.\n",
    "Experimental Evaluation: It is always recommended to experiment with different Naive Bayes classifiers \n",
    "on your specific dataset and evaluate their performance using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., \n",
    "accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score). This empirical evaluation will help you determine which variant \n",
    "of Naive Bayes performs better for your problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, consider the type of features, the assumption of feature independence, the nature of the \n",
    "problem (e.g., text classification), and the need for smoothing when choosing the appropriate Naive \n",
    "Bayes classifier. Additionally, experimental evaluation on your dataset can guide you in selecting the \n",
    "variant that yields the best performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q6. Assignment:\n",
    "You have a dataset with two features, X1 and X2, and two possible classes, A and B. You want to use Naive\n",
    "Bayes to classify a new instance with features X1 = 3 and X2 = 4. The following table shows the frequency of\n",
    "each feature value for each class:\n",
    "Class      X1=1       X1=2        X1=3        X2=1        X2=2         X2=3     X2=4\n",

    "B           2          2           1           2           2            2        3\n",
    "Assuming equal prior probabilities for each class, which class would Naive Bayes predict the new instance\n",
    "to belong to?\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Naive Bayes would predict that the new instance belongs to class A.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the probability of the new instance belonging to class A, we can use Bayes theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A|X1=3,X2=4) = P(X1=3,X2=4|A) * P(A) / P(X1=3,X2=4)\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of the new instance having features X1=3 and X2=4, given that it belongs to class A, is\n",
    "equal to the frequency of instances with those features in class A, divided by the total number of \n",
    "instances in class A. This is equal to 4 / 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of the new instance belonging to class A, given that it has features X1=3 and X2=4, is \n",
    "equal to the frequency of instances with those features in class A, divided by the total number of \n",
    "instances with those features. This is equal to 3 / 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of the new instance belonging to class A is equal to the product of these two \n",
    "probabilities, which is equal to 4/9 * 3/9 = 4/27.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of the new instance belonging to class B can be calculated in a similar way. The \n",
    "probability of the new instance having features X1=3 and X2=4, given that it belongs to class B, is \n",
    "equal to the frequency of instances with those features in class B, divided by the total number of \n",
    "instances in class B. This is equal to 1 / 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of the new instance belonging to class B, given that it has features X1=3 and X2=4, is \n",
    "equal to the frequency of instances with those features in class B, divided by the total number of \n",
    "instances with those features. This is equal to 2 / 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of the new instance belonging to class B is equal to the product of these two \n",
    "probabilities, which is equal to 1/7 * 2/7 = 2/49.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the probability of the new instance belonging to class A is greater than the probability of the \n",
    "new instance belonging to class B, Naive Bayes would predict that the new instance belongs to class A."
